# EDU-Copilot: Revolutionizing Academic Advising with AI

## Project Overview

EDU-Copilot was developed as the capstone project for an entrepreneurship class, with a primary focus on conceiving and articulating a comprehensive business venture plan. Our team's core mission was to address critical inefficiencies and inadequacies in traditional university advising by leveraging cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence to deliver tailored, comprehensive, and scalable student support. This project highlights extensive market research, strategic planning, and the articulation of a viable business model for an AI-driven academic advising tool.

## The Problem: An Under-Supported Higher Education Landscape

Today's higher education landscape is fraught with obstacles. Students frequently report feeling lost or unsupported, struggling to navigate complex degree requirements and connect their studies to future careers. Traditional university advising models are often overwhelmed by high student-to-advisor ratios, sometimes reaching as high as 625:1 at institutions like the University of Colorado Boulder. This imbalance severely limits customized help and leads to student frustration, inefficient course selections, and significant costs for universities related to retention and completion rates. Furthermore, students face challenges in discovering relevant financial aid.

## Our Solution: The EDU-Copilot AI Platform

EDU-Copilot is an AI-powered online platform designed to shape the future of student support by providing personalized and efficient academic and career advising to students. Unlike traditional advising, our platform offers convenience and accessibility, allowing students to receive personalized guidance anytime, anywhere.

**Key Features (demonstrated via an MVP):**
* **Intelligent AI Core:** Our platform allows students to enter their own information via document upload, such as academic records, fields of interest, skills, and career goals. AI then processes this information to suggest ideal course tracks and identify potential internship opportunities, and match student profiles to high-demand career paths.
* **Document Parsing Capability:** A unique differentiator, particularly for our direct-to-student offering, is our AI document parsing capability. Users can easily upload transcripts, degree requirements, and course catalogs, which our AI intelligently parses to establish a basis for student assistance.
* **Comprehensive Student Support:** Our system combines numerous academic and professional resources into a single platform, simplifying and modernizing academic advising strategies. This includes academic tracking, skills-based career planning, and actionable insights for both students and administrators.
* **Personalized Journey Visualization:** The platform allows users to visualize their degree path, plan semesters, and track requirements. It includes AI-suggested milestones and can integrate this timeline into a shareable portfolio.
* **Scalability:** Our servers are designed to hold a large scale of data and analyze it to cater to the needs of students. This provides a scalable solution to advisor shortages and has the potential to lower institutional advising costs while increasing student retention.

The website we created served as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) aimed at demonstrating the core functionality and user experience to potential investors. While the full product vision is expansive, the MVP effectively showcased the personalized planning, document parsing, and AI interaction capabilities, providing a tangible representation of our business plan's core technology. This was critical for a capstone project focused on a business plan rather than full product development.
